# StudyMatch

StudyMatch is a web app that connects UIUC students with potential study buddies based on similar classes and major. It is inspired by the fact that many people have a hard time finding study buddies or reaching out to others. This web app aims to match students to study buddies to help them find people to study with and has an emphasis on an academic standpoint rather than a social one.
